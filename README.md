# MoveByParagraph
SublimeText3 plugin to move by paragraph, lines with only spaces and/or tabs are treated as paragraph breaks.

Existing Sublime treats lines with just spaces and/or tabs as part of the surrounding paragraph.  Due to some of the other text tools I use, I need to leave such lines with their whitespace characters.  Since I can't fix the other proprietary tools, I have to fix Sublime.
